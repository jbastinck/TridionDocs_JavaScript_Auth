# TridionDocs_JavaScript_Auth
Sample script to authenticate to Tridion Docs using javascript

Tridion Docs allows you to connect to it using Soap request. This repo has examples on how to accomplish that using javascript. 

This library exists becuase Tridion Dot Net client currently has no dot net core support hence for you to connect to tridion docs 
from non-windows environment, you will need to create soap requests.
